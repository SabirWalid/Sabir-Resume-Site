            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="IMG-20230712-WA0020.jpg" alt="Sabir">
            <p class="short-line">My name is <b><s>Sabir Walid Abdurahman</s></b>, and I was born and 
                raised in Sudan. I hail from a marginalized group, and my early life was 
                shaped by the unique challenges faced by individuals within this community. 
                My journey took a significant turn when I became a refugee at the tender age 
                of 17, and I continued to navigate this life-altering experience until the 
                age of 22 in South Sudan.

                During my time as a refugee, I seized the opportunity to complete my secondary 
                school education. It was during this period that I meticulously documented some 
                of the prevailing challenges faced by the refugee community and, in particular, 
                the students among us. One issue that stood out prominently was the glaring 
                lack of access to higher education and the quality education that is so essential 
                for personal and community development.
                
                To put it into perspective, consider the fact that every year, we saw between 270 
                to 350 students successfully graduate from secondary school. However, when it 
                came to pursuing higher education, the numbers were starkly different. Only a 
                mere fraction, roughly 10 to 15 students, managed to access university or college 
                opportunities. The vast majority of these bright, young minds were left with little 
                choice but to remain within the confines of our community, their dreams and 
                aspirations left unfulfilled and unattained.
                
                It is this stark disparity, this heartbreaking reality, that has fueled my passion 
                and determination. My journey led me to the African Leadership University, where I 
                was fortunate to receive an education that opened up a world of possibilities. I now 
                find myself inspired and deeply committed to taking an active role in creating and 
                implementing an initiative that can effectively transform my community, providing 
                hope and opportunities where there was once despair. My aim is to make a meaningful 
                difference and empower those who have the potential to shape a brighter future.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Collector</h3>
                    <p>Append - China</p>
                    <p>Apr, 2023 - Aug, 2023</p>
                    <p class="short-line">In my role as a data collector, I undertook the 
                        crucial task of gathering data from a wide array of sources. This 
                        included not only the collection process but also the responsibility of 
                        meticulously storing this valuable data in a database. However, my duties 
                        didn't end there. I was also entrusted with the task of performing data 
                        analysis, an essential step in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

                        In addition to collecting and analyzing data, another aspect of my role involved 
                        the preparation of comprehensive reports. These reports were designed to 
                        encapsulate the findings and trends derived from the data, offering a clear and 
                        insightful perspective to guide decision-making processes. Upon their completion, 
                        I diligently submitted these reports to my supervisor, providing them with valuable 
                        information and insights to inform strategic decisions and actions.
                        
                        One significant aspect of this experience was the fact that it marked my first 
                        foray into remote work. This transition brought its own set of unique challenges 
                        and opportunities. Working remotely, I found myself adapting to new tools, 
                        communication methods, and a more independent work environment. These adaptations, 
                        while initially presenting challenges, ultimately provided me with a valuable 
                        learning experience, enhancing my skills and capabilities in the field of data 
                        analytics.

                    <p class="short-line">During my time volunteering at the Pan African Mathematics 
                        Olympiad, my responsibilities encompassed guiding students throughout their 
                        competitions, as well as meticulously evaluating and marking their examination 
                        papers. This experience not only allowed me to contribute to the growth and 
                        development of young mathematicians but also provided me with a deeper 
                        understanding of the challenges and aspirations of the students within this 
                        academic sphere.

                    <p>Internation Rescue Committee - South Sudan</p>
                    <p>Dec, 2021 - June, 2022</p>
                    <p class="short-line">In my role as a data entry assistant in the Department of 
                        WASH (Water Sanitation and Hygiene), my primary responsibility was to oversee 
                        the comprehensive management of data within the department. This entailed 
                        meticulously collecting, organizing, and inputting data from various sources, 
                        all with the overarching goal of maintaining the integrity and accuracy of our 
                        information repository. Ensuring that every piece of data was managed with 
                        precision was of paramount importance to us, as it directly contributed to the 
                        overall effectiveness and success of our department's initiatives.

                        Additionally, I was tasked with the crucial duty of regularly reviewing and 
                        updating the existing data to guarantee that it remained current and relevant. 
                        By doing so, we ensured that our decision-makers had access to the most accurate 
                        and up-to-date information, enabling them to make informed choices that would 
                        have a positive impact on the vital areas of water sanitation and hygiene. My 
                        role as a data entry assistant was not merely administrative; it was integral 
                        to the department's mission of improving access to clean water and promoting 
                        hygiene, underlining the significance of data accuracy in our noble pursuit.

                       empower them to contribute to the societies and foster self-reliance and
