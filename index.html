            <img src="IMG-20230712-WA0020.jpg" alt="Sabir">
            <p class="short-line">My name is Sabir Walid Abdurahman born and raised  up to the age of 16
               from a marginalised group in Sudan and became a refugee from the age of 
               17-22 in South Sudan. While as a refugee where I did my secondary school
               education I jotted down some of the main challenges faced by the refugee 
               community and the students which lack of access to higher and quality 
               education being the first because every year between 270 - 350 students 
               graduate from secondary school but only 10 to 15 of them go to university 
               or collage and the all remaining population just stay in the community and 
               lost their dreams and missions. Thatâ€™s why for me, being lucky to study at 
               the African Leadership University I am passionate about taking an active 
               role and implementing an initiative that will transform my community.

                    <p class="short-line">This is my personal project that I am currently working on. It is 
                       a transformational program dedicated to equipping refugees with essential 
                       technical skills to enhance their livelihoods. This program aims to address 
                       the unique challenges faced by refugees by providing them with access to 
                       quality education and training in various technical fields such as computer 
                       programming, vocational skills, and digital literacy.
                       Through partnership with educational institutions, government, NGOs, and 
                       industrial leaders, this initiative offers refugees opportunities to acquire 
                       the valuable skills that not only improve their employment prospects but also 
                       empower them to contribute to the societies and foster self-reliance and 
                       independence to break down the barriers and create a  more inclusive and 
                       equitable future for refugees.
